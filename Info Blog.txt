•	User registration, login and logout.
•	View some content (e.g. blog articles, listings, photos, issues, publications).
•	Create new content (e.g. post new blog article, post new listing, upload new photo, create new issue).
Your project should keep its data in a database or in a backend service:
•	Use at least 2 tables (collections) with a relationship, e.g. users and blog posts.
•	Use a database (like MySQL or MongoDB) or cloud-based backend (like Kinvey, MongoLab or RedisLab).
Your project should implement at least 4 pages (views).
You are allowed to create a project which is very similar to the “Blog System” developed during the course.
You are allowed even to take the Blog System source code and modify it for your needs.
